# Interaction-Aware-Plane-FFT
This project implements and evaluates an interaction-aware piecewise plane model for approximate complex multiplication in FFT architectures. Unlike conventional plane-based approximations, the proposed design incorporates a cross-term (m⋅a) to improve modelling accuracy while maintaining hardware efficiency.
