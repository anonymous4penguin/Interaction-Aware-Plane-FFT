# Interaction-Aware-Plane-FFT
This project implements and evaluates an interaction-aware piecewise plane model for approximate complex multiplication in FFT architectures. Unlike conventional plane-based approximations, the proposed design incorporates a cross-term (m⋅a) to improve modelling accuracy while maintaining hardware efficiency.

The work includes:
1. Piecewise plane coefficient generation
2. Bit-width constrained interaction modeling
3. Plane-wise RMSE analysis
4. MRED and NMED evaluation
5. Frequency-domain spectral distortion analysis (NMSE, RSD, etc.)
6. EEG-based FFT validation
